# Awk experiments

For many years I've danced around `awk` instead of actually learning to use it.  I figured I
could skate by and instead learn Perl or Python.  Well, I've some fluency with those languages
now, and I *still* have a use for `awk`, or `gawk`, more properly.  I don't write quite so many
shell scripts these days, but I'm completing a Udemy course on the subject, and there was `awk`
right back where it has always been, and me not knowing my `RS` from my `FS`, so I created this
repo to give myself a place to practice.

Oh, I'm taking a course from Lynda.com entitled `AWK: Essential Training`.  We'll see how it
goes.
